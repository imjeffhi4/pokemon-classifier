# Intro

This repository contains the docker file used to build the Svelte app shown in the GIF above. It uses a fine-tuned version of ViT trained on a dataset of Pokemon I collected. If you’re interested in using this model, I’ve also made it available on Hugging Face [here](https://huggingface.co/imjeffhi/pokemon_classifier). 

# About

- Data was collected using a mixture of [Veekun images](https://veekun.com/dex/downloads), [PokemonDB](https://pokemondb.net/), and images scraped from [Brave Search](https://brave.com/search/).
- Training was performed using PyTorch-lightning and used ViT-base (see training folder for source code).
- Frontend demo was created using Svelte which was served using FastAPI.

# Results

The model was able to achieve 95% accuracy on my validation dataset. Though, feel free to check out the demo and try it yourself!
